        <p>For amazon.com the design that they had back in 1999. The overall layout 
        and where things are located are pretty much the same as current amazon 
        but it is styed differently than what they currently have. For example
        lots of hyperlinks they're color scheme is different. They also have a
        home landing page where they explain how to use amazon and what they are. 
        Nowadays no need for an explanation. More text based design. I also 
        noticed they started to add more catogories as the years went on and 
        changed from more word based to picture based.</p>
