        <p>Based on some of the readings it’s clear how far technology has come since then. Specifically in Technology and Ideology: The Case of the Telegraph by James Carey he mentions how the introduction of the Telegraph changed how people interacted with each other. It changed how people receive news and information and changed society in general. It made me think about how new technology has changed how the world works since I was born. Thinking back, I remember getting my first cell phone slide phone and being so excited. I remember using it all the time but I can’t imagine what I was doing. I only had my relatives numbers and there was maybe two simple games on it. Either way phones were still very much addicting. Nowadays because of all the new apps and features and cameras they are of course even more addicting. It makes me wonder if any of the authors realized just how phone and internet crazy society would become. For my portrait I wanted to share some different aspects of my life including how I use social media. In one of the sections I included my favorite apps and I wanted to expand upon how and why I use them. The one I use the most is spotify. This is a music streaming app where you can listen to almost any music and make and share playlists that you create. I specifically Like Spotify over other music apps because of how easy it is to find new music to listen to. The playlists made by spotify and by other users makes it one of my favorites. Another one of my most used apps is Netflix. One thing that I enjoy doing in my free time is watching movies and so this is a great way for me to find new movies. They also have original content that I really enjoy as well. The last one of my favorite apps is actually the one where you can interact with people the most. Twitter is a platform where people can share their thoughts, vidoes, and pictures. I personally don’t find myself posting anything but rather I use it to browse what others are posting. A lot of the time it’s funny content or things happening in pop culture but there is also news content. For example all political news that has been going on as of late. I find that because I don’t watch cable news on a regular basis I get a lot of my information from sites like this. Because not everything you see on the internet is true, I try to take most things I see on Twitter with a grain of salt until I do my own research. But browsing Twitter for me is a good way to keep updated with what’s going on in the world. This realization sounds a lot like what Carey wrote about in his piece. He explained how “The significance of the telegraph... led to the selective control and transmission of information”(Carey 10). It seems like something similarly is happening nowadays in our society. Because of all the information that people are able to put on the internet its hard to understand which ones are legitimate. It’s interesting to see how the same issues are still happening with different technologies throughout the years.</p>
