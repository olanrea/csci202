                We decided to pick the Log Ramp sculpture created by Lloyd Hamrol because of its convenience 
                and potential for user interactivity. Hamrol is known for creating pieces that are meant to 
                interact with surrounding environment. The logs were meant to have the viewer climb and see an 
                imaginary circle inscribed within the center. The Log Ramps sit on a grassy hill in the center of 
                outh campus. It serves many purposes for students and visitors. For example, a place to sit and 
                study, sleep, observe, people watch, eat, and relax. It also serves as an art piece that people 
                can observe and enjoy on their walk-through Western Washington University located in Bellingham. 
                We ultimately picked this piece by the talented Hamrol, because we wanted to be able to showcase 
                different aspects of the viewers experience. This seemed like the best sculpture to achieve that 
                with. For our home page we wanted to introduce the artist, Lloyd Harmol, giving the user background 
                information about his younger years as well as explaining his vision regarding the log ramps. 
                We wanted to incorporate sound and images to allow users to evoke different feelings, experiences, 
                and to feel inspired.<br><br>
                We chose six different audio recording that ranged from spooky, relaxing, happy, intense, and 
                just weird. The music was accompanied by an area where people could write down and express 
                their thoughts and how their interpretation of the sculpture changed with each new sound. It 
                took us a while to get the audio to work. We had problems downloading the audio files and 
                imbedding them to our code. There was a point where it worked on desktop but not on mobile. 
                It was frustrating but we eventually were able to get it to work on both. We also added 
                different images for each sound to enhance the feelings accompanied by the music. To help 
                guide the users through our mobile site we implemented alert notifications at the top of the 
                page prompting them to explore the different options to enhance their experience. <br><br>
                We also implemented a drawing page on our mobile site. Here, users had the option to choose 
                images of the Log Ramps as well as a blank canvas to draw on. The idea was that as users 
                walked around or sat on the Log Ramps, they could make art of their own. We provided different 
                views of the Log Ramps including an overhead shot, a landscape version, and repeated patterns 
                of the image. The intention for this was so that people could create their own art as well as 
                add to Hamrol’s original vision. Design wise, we chose to use a greyish, earthy color palate 
                to enhance the natural colors found in the sculpture’s surroundings. Especially because the 
                sculpture is made of Douglas Fir and western Red Cedar. These are native trees to the area 
                which is a defining feature in Hamrol’s work of art. <br><br>
                If given the opportunity to improve our mobile site and the users experience, we would have 
                made the site more interactive within a community. We wanted the user’s entries from the sound 
                page as well as their drawing from the drawing page to have been collected and showcased on a 
                page where they could not only see their contributions, but also the contributions of other 
                users. This would have enhanced the users experience not only with the sculpture but with the 
                mobile site itself. Throughout making this website we used many resources such as w3schools, 
                our TA, bootstrap, our peers, and of course google. This project gave us a real taste of how 
                important time management is in regard to group projects in computer science. We had to learn 
                how to use GitHub in order to be able upload code to the same repository. Communication was 
                also very important because we didn’t want to duplicate work or mess up each other’s code. 
                We also had to make time to meet outside of class to complete this unique assignment. <br><br>
                Overall this was a really good experience because we got to experiment with and combine 
                computer science, design, teamwork. We appreciated the fact that this project had students 
                step out of the classroom and experience computer science through a new lens as opposed to 
                the typical website assignments we are so used to from past computer science classes.
